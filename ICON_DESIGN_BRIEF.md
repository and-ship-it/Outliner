# Thinkery App Icon Design Brief

---

## Product Context

**App Name:** Thinkery

**Tagline:** "A thinking space, not a storage system"

**What it is:** A fast, keyboard-first outliner for organizing thoughts. Weekly documents that reset, so it's always fresh. A staging area for ideas before they graduate to permanent storage (Obsidian, Notion, etc.)

**Platform:** macOS and iOS (needs to work as both desktop and mobile icon)

## Brand Personality

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Fast** | Speed of thought, not sluggish |
| **Light** | Ephemeral, not heavy/permanent |
| **Clear** | Organized thinking, not cluttered |
| **Focused** | One thing done well |
| **Premium** | Apple-quality, not cheap |
| **Calm** | Reduces anxiety, not adds to it |

**NOT:** Playful/cute, corporate/serious, complex, busy, dark/heavy

## Visual Direction

### Concept Ideas (pick one or combine)

1. **Abstract thought/mind** — A simplified representation of thinking (not a literal brain)
2. **Flowing lines** — Suggests outlines + movement + reorganization
3. **Spark/lightbulb moment** — The "aha" of organized thinking
4. **Nested structure** — Subtle nod to outline hierarchy
5. **Open space** — Breathing room, not cluttered

### Color Direction

- **Primary:** Warm, approachable — consider soft coral, warm amber, or gentle teal
- **Avoid:** Cold corporate blue, harsh neon, black/dark themes
- **Style:** Gradient is fine (modern iOS style), but subtle — not overwhelming

### Shape Language

- Rounded, soft edges (Apple HIG friendly)
- Simple, recognizable at 16px
- Geometric but not cold
- Could incorporate subtle bullet point or line motif

## Technical Requirements

| Size | Context |
|------|---------|
| 1024x1024 | App Store |
| 512x512 | macOS large |
| 256x256 | macOS medium |
| 128x128 | macOS small |
| 180x180 | iOS (iPhone) |
| 167x167 | iOS (iPad Pro) |
| 152x152 | iOS (iPad) |
| 16x16 | macOS tiny (menu bar, if needed) |

- Must be recognizable at all sizes
- No fine details that disappear at small sizes
- Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines for app icons
- Provide as vector (SVG) + PNG exports

## What to Avoid

- Literal brain imagery (overused, clinical)
- Light bulbs (cliche)
- Gears/cogs (too mechanical)
- Checkboxes/todo lists (this isn't a task manager)
- Pencils/pens (too generic "notes app")
- Complex illustrations with many elements
- Text in the icon
- Thin lines that disappear at small sizes

---

## Inspiration References

- **Bear App** — Warm, simple, memorable mascot approach
- **Things 3** — Clean, focused, premium feel
- **Craft** — Modern, subtle gradient, sophisticated
- **Linear** — Geometric, minimal, recognizable
- **Notion** — Simple but maybe too cold/corporate

## Deliverables

1. 3 distinct concept directions as rough sketches
2. 1 refined final direction based on feedback
3. Final icon in all required sizes
4. Vector source file (Figma/Sketch/SVG)
5. Light and dark mode variants if applicable

---

## Success Criteria

The icon should:

- Be instantly recognizable in a dock full of apps
- Feel like it belongs next to Apple's native apps
- Convey "thinking" without being literal
- Feel light, fast, and calming
- Make someone want to tap/click it
